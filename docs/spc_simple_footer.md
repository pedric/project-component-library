*- A supersimple footer designed as a component for Spacecraft Starterkit*

## Quick start

No config.json needed, set your name in the `data-spc_simple_footer` attribute like this: `data-spc_simple_footer="company name"` in spc_simple_footer.twig.

Change the color variable or it's value in scss-file to customise. By default itÂ´s the same style for p-, span- and a elements.

The span element will contain `@YEAR` + `name` set as described above.
